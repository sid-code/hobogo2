SPLASH TEXT:
Odysearch can help you explore the world with the cheapest flights possible.
You provide destinations and it chooses an order and times within your constraints.

TIPS:
The wider your search range, the lower you can expect the price to be.
Be mindful that popular airports (for example, LAX) have more, and therefore some cheaper flights.
(optional) This tool is useless if you already have decided exactly when or in what order you want to visit your destinations
